# STRAW_analysis
Analysis of simulations and measurements taken from STRings for Absorption length in Water (STRAW) to determine the optical properties of the deep seawater in the Pacific Ocean. Specifically, we need to determine the absorption, scattering, and attenuation length of the site.

It is planned for a neutrino telescope, P-ONE, to be deployed at the site, so characterization of the optical properties of the water is critical.
